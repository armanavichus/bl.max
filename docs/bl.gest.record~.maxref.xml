		Record gestures into a polybuffer~
	</digest>
	
	<description>
		Tool to record uni- or multivariate time series sequences into audio buffers. 
		After you switch on the device, it is listening to incoming arrays of features, 
		and records them into a polybuffer~. If you stayed inactive for the amount of the 
		"waittime" (ms) the device will think that the gesture is over, terminating the recording. 
		If you want to build a large database of short gestures, use a short waittime, like 500 ms, 
		if you would rather record longer phrases with intermittent pauses inside, choose a longer 
		wittime, like 3000-4000 ms.
		<br/>
		The benefit of recording gestures into audio buffers is that you can have better time precision, 
		the possibility to record extremely long sequences, and use the synergy with some built-in 
		Max objects, such as simple buffer~-based playback tools, such as play~, wave~ or groove~.
